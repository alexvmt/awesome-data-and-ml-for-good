# Awesome data and machine learning for good

Inspired by other awesome lists on GitHub
(like [this](https://github.com/metakermit/awesome-python-for-social-good),
[this](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)
and [this](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning))
we decided to set out and create one for using data and machine learning for good causes as well.

There are some other nice repositories on GitHub
(like [this](https://github.com/darenasc/data-science-for-good),
[this](https://github.com/shreyashankar/datasets-for-good)
and [this](https://github.com/dssg/hitchhikers-guide))
that collect information on this topic. We aim to be complementary. Contributions are welcome. Just go ahead and create a pull request!

But what does *"using data and machine learing for good causes"* mean anyway?
In a nutshell, one could say that a data-driven application or machine learning use case contributes to a good cause if it is alligned with at least one of the United Nations' Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.V
This is of course a very broad definition and specific applications and use cases should always be assessed with more scrutiny.
